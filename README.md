# General info
ProBuild is a unique web application designed to make the viewing of NBA Basketball players and their respective skills eaiser and more efficient than ever before. Anyone with access to this application can seamlessly create, review, update, and delete players to the database globally.

# Technologies

## 100% Coverage on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
In order to enhance user experience, our developers optimized the web application to fully follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This feat was achieved with help of a Google Chrome Extension called Accessibility Insights for Web. With the use of this extension, the application passed full coverage tests.

## AWS DynamoDB

ProBuild is backed by one of the world's fastest database and efficient services: Amazon Web Services. Our database utilizes the DynamoDB NoSQL database.

## Jest Testing Framework

Our application is tested using Jest ultimately reducing errors and problems.

## Material UI

The User Interface is built using Material UI.

## S3 Bucket

Our application is hosted using an AWS S3 Bucket.
